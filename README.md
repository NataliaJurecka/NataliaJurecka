ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @NataliaJurecka, some people call me Nat.  
Curiosity - for gaming comunity I'm Leqsei ðŸ˜ƒ. 

For now I'm open to work offers as Junior JavaScript developer and mostly interested in working for companies that will help me get more knowledge and progress my abilities. 
I have really big ambitions and I don't want to stop learning, not only in IT, but in many other ways.  
In future I want to become a fullStack developer and I hope to end course in a few months to get a base for that.  

As I just said, I'm still in progress of learning. The languages and tools I'm using are JS, React, HTML5, CSS, SASS, Git and Node.  

I'm daily (or mostly daily) easy to reach in my email address jurecka.natalia22@gmail.com  
or on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-jurecka/.
